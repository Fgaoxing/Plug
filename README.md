## Note

* The order of plugin outputs found will be disrupted for fairness (which is a feature inherited from [upstream](https://github.com/lilingfengdev/PluginSearchEngine).

## GUI & CLI

See [PluginSearchEngine (Upstream)](https://github.com/lilingfengdev/PluginSearchEngine).

### Environment
1. See `requirements.txt` for extra modules.
2. Consider to use PyCharm rather than any other IDEs. <sub>(Trust me there are important reasons behind that.)</sub>
